# Informed Cinema

Every time me and my family are considering whether or not a particular movie is worth watching, I manually check IMDb, Plugged In, and Kids in Mind for information about the movie.  In addition, those three websites are hard to check from a mobile phone, which I do often in the store.

This project automatically loads information from those three sources given any movie and displays it on one page.  The design is responsive, so it works on mobile.

## Future Improvements

I have scripts for scanning subtitles and detecting profanity, so that information could also be added to the review page.

It could automatically detect newly released movies that I thought might be interesting from preset thresholds and automatically email me with movie info.

## Interested?
