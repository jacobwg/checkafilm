# Check a Film

Every time my family and I are considering whether or not a particular movie is worth watching, I manually check IMDb, Plugged In, and Kids in Mind for information about the movie.  Additionally, we are often in the store, and those three websites are hard to check from a mobile phone.

This project automatically loads information from those three sources given any movie title and conveniently displays that information on a responsive mobile-friendly website.

## Future Improvements

I have scripts for scanning subtitles and detecting profanity, so that information could also be added to the review page.

It could automatically detect newly released movies that I thought might be interesting from preset thresholds and automatically email me with movie info.

## Interested?

If this is something you'd like to use too, email me at [me@jacobwg.com](mailto:me@jacobwg.com) - I'd love to talk with you.
